# TypeScript Project: tsHelloWorld

## Summary
This Activity is meant to be a small exploration of the typescript features before utilizing it in a full project.

## Focus
The main testing goals and features I hope to develop are:
    - Learning what makes Typescript more appealing than plain Javascript
    - Understanding of the Typescript fundamentals
    - Gaining experience with setting up Typescript projects
    - Explore some of the more advanced features that Typescript provides

## Installation
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`).
2. Install TypeScript globally by running:
    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```

### 1. Compile the TypeScript Files
Use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to compile the `.ts` files into JavaScript:
```bash
tsc advanced.ts
tsc fundamentals.ts
tsc twofer.ts
```

This will generate `advanced.js` and `fundamentals.js` in the same directory.

### 2. Run the Compiled JavaScript Files
Use Node.js to execute the compiled JavaScript files:
```bash
node advanced.js
node fundamentals.js
node twofer.ts
```

## Notes
- Ensure you are in the project directory before running the commands.
- If you encounter any issues, verify that TypeScript is installed correctly by running:
  ```bash
  tsc --version
  ```
- You can also use a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) for more advanced setups.
